Issue Summary:
Duration: March 25th, 2023 9:30 AM - March 26th, 2023 4:00 PM (UTC-5)
Impact: The user login service was down, resulting in users being unable to access their
accounts or authenticate to use the application. Approximately 75% of users were affected.
Root Cause: An upgrade to the authentication system introduced a bug that caused the service
to fail.
Timeline:
9:30 AM: The issue was first detected when users started reporting problems logging in.
9:35 AM: The engineering team received automated alerts indicating a problem with the user
authentication service.
9:40 AM: Engineers began investigating the problem, focusing on the authentication service and
the underlying database.
10:15 AM: The investigation led to a dead end, as there were no obvious issues with the
authentication service or database.
10:30 AM: The team began investigating the network infrastructure, as the issue could be
related to connectivity problems.
11:30 AM: After several hours of investigation, the team ruled out network connectivity problems
and began focusing on the authentication system itself.
2:00 PM: An engineer discovered that an upgrade to the authentication system had introduced a
bug that caused the service to fail.
3:00 PM: The incident was escalated to senior engineering management for additional support.
4:00 PM: The engineering team began working on a fix for the issue.
7:00 PM: The fix was tested and deployed to the production environment.
8:00 PM: The authentication service was fully restored, and users were able to log in without
any issues.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a bug introduced during an upgrade to the authentication
system. The bug caused the service to fail when users attempted to authenticate. The
engineering team was able to fix the bug by rolling back the upgrade and deploying a new
version of the authentication system that addressed the issue.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues in the future, the engineering team will implement several corrective
and preventative measures, including:
Conducting more thorough testing of system upgrades before deploying them to production.
Improving monitoring and alerting to detect similar issues more quickly.
Developing better documentation and processes for handling incidents and escalations.
Adding additional redundancy and failover mechanisms to critical systems.
Conducting a post-mortem analysis to identify additional areas for improvement.
Specific tasks to address the issue include:

Roll back the authentication system upgrade to the previous version.
Deploy the fixed version of the authentication system to the production environment.
Update monitoring and alerting systems to detect similar issues more quickly.
Review incident response processes and documentation to identify areas for improvement.
Implement additional redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical systems.
In conclusion, the outage was caused by a bug introduced during an upgrade to the
authentication system, resulting in a service disruption that affected 75% of users. The
engineering team was able to resolve the issue by rolling back the upgrade and deploying a
new version of the authentication system. To prevent similar issues in the future, the team will
implement several corrective and preventative measures, including improved testing,
monitoring, and incident response processes.
The incident has caused significant inconvenience to users, resulting in lost productivity and
potential financial impact for the company. To mitigate the impact of the outage, the company
has issued a public apology to affected users and offered compensation for any losses incurred
due to the disruption.
Moving forward, the engineering team will continue to monitor the system closely and implement
additional measures to improve reliability and prevent future outages. This includes investing in
more comprehensive testing and quality assurance processes, as well as implementing a more
robust incident response framework to ensure timely and effective resolution of any future
incidents.
Overall, the incident serves as a valuable learning experience for the company, highlighting the
importance of maintaining strong systems and processes to ensure reliable and uninterrupted
service for users. By taking proactive measures to address the root cause of the outage and
implementing preventative measures to improve system resiliency, the company can help
ensure that similar incidents are prevented in the future, preserving user trust and satisfaction
with the service.
